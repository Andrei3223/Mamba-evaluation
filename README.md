# Mamba-evaluation

In this project, we have focused on Mamba model evaluation and comparison with transformer based models.

### mamba-model.py

In this file you can find Mamba simple implementation example.

### gans-mamba.ipynb

Here we compare GPT2 and Mamba for in-context learning tasks

### eval_mamba.ipynb

We test models of different sizes (130m and 1.4b Mamba, 137m and 1.6b GPT2). Evaluation tasks are Lambada,  WinoGrande,  ARC,  PIQA.
